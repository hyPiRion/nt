# nt

nt is a Clojure library for number theory functions. If you're directly
interested in primes and prime generation, you should have a look at [primes][],
which is a library for fast and concurrent prime generation in Clojure.

## Usage

The library contains a lot of small but useful functions from number theory,
grouped under different namespaces based upon their category.
