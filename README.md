# nt
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hyPiRion/nt.png)](https://travis-ci.org/hyPiRion/nt)

nt is a Clojure library for number theory functions. If you're directly
interested in primes and prime generation, you should have a look at [primes][],
which is a library for fast and concurrent prime generation in Clojure. nt is
currently inactive, and would require a lot more utility functions to be useful.
However, changes in the library are likely to be feature additions, so
`0.x.y`-releases should generally be backwards compatible.

## Usage

The library contains a lot of small but useful functions from number theory,
grouped under different namespaces based upon their category.
